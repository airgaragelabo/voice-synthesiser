\subsection{IPA transcription and VPM description}

\ipa{nɔɪz}:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \ipa{n} voiced alveolar nasal (sonorant) 
	\item \ipa{ɔɪ} transitions loosely between three states with the latter two vowels taking up the majority of the transition \ipa{ʌɔi}: \begin{itemize}
		\item \ipa{ʌ} starts back open-mid, moves further open, then closes and moves forward
		\item \ipa{ɔ} moves further open
		\item \ipa{i} closes and moves forward
	\end{itemize}
	\item \ipa{z} voiced alveolar fricative (obstruent) although, in this case, the voicing is low level and decays before the end of the fricative, which takes on an \ipa{s} quality
\end{itemize}
