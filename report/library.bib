abstract = {Every parametric speech synthesizer requires a good excitation model to produce speech that sounds natural. In this paper, we describe efforts toward building one such model using the Liljencrants-Fant (LF) model. We used the Iterative Adaptive Inverse Filtering technique to derive an initial estimate of the glottal flow derivative (GFD). Candidate pitch periods in the estimated GFD were then located and LF model parameters estimated using a gradient descent optimization algorithm. Residual energy in the GFD, after subtracting the fitted LF signal, was then modeled by a 4-term LPC model plus energy term to extend the excitation model and account for source information not captured by the LF model. The ClusterGen speech synthesizer was then trained to predict these excitation parameters from text so that the excitation model could be used for speech synthesis. ClusterGen excitation predictions were further used to reinitialize the excitation fitting process and iteratively improve the fit by including modeled voicing and segmental influences on the LF parameters. The results of all of these methods have been confirmed both using listening tests and objective metrics. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2013 ISCA.},

abstract = {Voice quality variations include a set of voicing sound source modifications ranging from laryngealized to normal to breathy phonation. Analysis of reiterant imitations of two sentences by ten female and six male talkers has shown that the potential acoustic cues to this type of voice quality variation include: (1) increases to the relative amplitude of the fundamental frequency component as open quotient increases; (2) increases to the amount of aspiration noise that replaces higher frequency harmonics as the arytenoids become more separated; (3) increases to lower formant bandwidths; and (4) introduction of extra pole zeros in the vocal-tract transfer function associated with tracheal coupling. Perceptual validation of the relative importance of these cues for signaling a breathy voice quality has been accomplished using a new voicing source model for synthesis of more natural male and female voices. The new formant synthesizer, KLSYN88, is fully documented here. Results of the perception study indicate that, contrary to previous research which emphasizes the importance of increased amplitude of the fundamental component, aspiration noise is perceptually most important. Without its presence, increases to the fundamental component may induce the sensation of nasality in a high-pitched voice. Further results of the acoustic analysis include the observations that: (1) over the course of a sentence, the acoustic manifestations of breathiness vary considerably—tending to increase for unstressed syllables, in utterance-final syllables, and at the margins of voiceless consonants; (2) on average, females are more breathy than males, but there are very large differences between subjects within each gender; (3) many utterances appear to end in a ``breathy-laryngealized'' type of vibration; and (4) diplophonic irregularities in the timing of glottal periods occur frequently, especially at the end of an utterance. Diplophonia and other deviations from perfect periodicity may be important aspects of naturalness in synthesis. },

"Along with the magnitude of the glottal closure excitation, Ee , the modeled waveform can be specified by two independent sets of parameters: the direct synthesis parameters ( ,$\alpha$,$\omega$ ,$\epsilon$ E0 g ), and the timing parameters (Tp Te Ta Tc , , , ). The parameter Tp denotes the instant of the maximum glottal flow. The parameter To is the fundamental period. The parameter Tc denotes the ending of the return phase. The parameter Ta is the effective duration of the return phase. The exponent $\epsilon$ in Eq. (2) is related to Ta and can be uniquely determined from Ta . Since the timing parameters can be easily identified from the estimated derivative glottal wave, one usually obtains the timing parameters and then derives the direct synthesis parameters from the timing parameters with the following constraints:" (has diagram indicating parameters)

abstract = {A glottal flow model with four independent parameters is described: It is referred to as the LF-model. Three of these pertain to the frequency, amplitude, and the exponential growth constant of a sinusoid. The fourth parameter is the time constant of an exponential recovery, i.e., return phase, from the point of maximum closing discontinuity towards maximum closure. The four parameters are interrelated by a condition of net flow gain within a fundamental perid which is usually set to zero. The finite return phase with a time constant t is partly equivalent to a first order low-pass filtering with cutoff {\&}equency Fa = (2TCta)-'. in the sense that it ensures an overall fit to commonly encountered wave shapes with a minimum number of parameters and is flexible in its ability to match extreme phonations. Apart from analytically com- plicated parameter interdependencies, it sbuld led itself to simple digital implementations. The LF-model is optimal for non-interactive flow parameterization},

gives some more detail in some of the things claimed by the above paper


significance of U{\_}o is its close relation to the amplitude of the voice fundamental
E{\_}e determinant of formant amplitudes

dependnencies of E{\_}e and U{\_}o on F{\_}0 scaled differently for male and female voices (Fant {\&} Kruckenberg, 1994)

discusses “analysis by synthesis”  “in which a spectral section of the recorded sound is compared with the output of a reference synthesiser, the parameter settings of which are varied to provide an optimal spectral match” sounds a lot like wha ti'm doing with mine


mentions “coordination of glottal adjustments, adduction/abduction gestores, F0-control, and lung pressure” which raises an interesting point - that even if u vary parameters of the glottal model and vary vocal tract there is still varying lung pressure which can affect things e.g. loudness - how does this play a part in words?


gives some typical examples for male and female vowels **VERY USEFUL**


discusses effects of moving parameters, e..g breahtyness, and sonorousness


discusses H1-H2 as voice quality measure


discusses problems comparing relative amplitudes in FFTs


discusses problems maintainign high freq content in cascade formant synthesis


discusses R{\_}d values for voice consonants being larger than of speaker's vowels, and with R{\_}a generally higher


describes typical range of R{\_}d (0.4{\textless}R{\_}d{\textless}2.7). R{\_}d {\textgreater} 2.7 devoted to transitions into abducted termination of voicing. male voices typically have smaller R{\_}d than female voices 
voiced consonants have larger R{\_}d than the speakers vowels
Voiced consonants typically show larger R{\_}a, i.e. lower F{\_}a values than predicted from R{\_}d alone 

found that 8/9 poles up to 8kHz needed for male synthesis and 6-7 for child or female synthesis

number of formant circuits should be m=F{\_}s(l{\_}e/c) where l{\_}e is effective length of vocal tract. normal variations of l{\_}e with articulation i.e. particular vowel should also be considered

glottal source and vocal-tract dynamics are intimately connected and influenced by prosody},

abstract = {The great majority of current voice technology applications rely on acoustic features, such as the widely used MFCC or LP parameters, which characterize the vocal tract response. Nonetheless, the major source of excitation, namely the glottal flow, is expected to convey useful complementary information. The glottal flow is the airflow passing through the vocal folds at the glottis. Unfortunately, glottal flow analysis from speech recordings requires specific and complex processing operations, which explains why it has been generally avoided. This paper gives a comprehensive overview of techniques for glottal source processing. Starting from analysis tools for pitch tracking, detection of glottal closure instant, estimation and modeling of glottal flow, this paper discusses how these tools and techniques might be properly integrated in various voice technology applications. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {In current methods for voice transformation and speech synthesis, the vocal tract filter is usually assumed to be excited by a flat amplitude spectrum. In this article, we present a method using a mixed source model defined as a mixture of the Liljencrants-Fant (LF) model and Gaussian noise. Using the LF model, the base approach used in this presented work is therefore close to a vocoder using exogenous input like ARX-based methods or the Glottal Spectral Separation (GSS) method. Such approaches are therefore dedicated to voice processing promising an improved naturalness compared to generic signal models. To estimate the Vocal Tract Filter (VTF), using spectral division like in GSS, we show that a glottal source model can be used with any envelope estimation method conversely to ARX approach where a least square AR solution is used. We therefore derive a VTF estimate which takes into account the amplitude spectra of both deterministic and random components of the glottal source. The proposed mixed source model is controlled by a small set of intuitive and independent parameters. The relevance of this voice production model is evaluated, through listening tests, in the context of resynthesis, HMM-based speech synthesis, breathiness modification and pitch transposition. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.
